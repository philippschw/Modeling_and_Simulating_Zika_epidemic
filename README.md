***Short Summary*** 
* Large-scale simulation model that pulls in big (geo-referenced) data from different sources including maps, census data and model-based predictions on global air travel and (mosquito) species distribution. 

## Simulation input data

Simulation is based on monthly data on vector presence of Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus.

## Preliminary Results
For each incident, the database records the:

* Date
* Country and specific location, including geocodes
* Number of aid workers affected (victims)
* Sex of victims
* Institutional affiliation of victims (UN/Red Cross/NGO/other)
* Type of staff (national or international)*
* Outcome of the incident (victims killed/wounded/kidnapped)
* Means of violence (e.g. shooting, IED, aerial bombardment)
* Context of attack (ambush, armed incursion, etc.)
* Summary of incident (public details)
