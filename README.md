***Key Outcome:*** 
* Risks to humanitarian aid workers are power law distributed. A small number of insecure locations (Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Pakistan) account for most of the incidents.

* Over the last fifteen years the number of serious incidents has continously increased and is now more than 4 times higher than 15 years ago. 
* The increase of attacks does primarily affected national humanitarian aid workers!

* The types of violence directed at aid workers is dependent on the regional contexts. Looking into data from 2015 shows that in Afghanistan kidnapping is the prevalent mean of attack. However, in Sudan and Somalia, in contrast, shootings and (sexual) assualt are the most signifiant type of violence. Incidents caused by explosives and heavy weapons are with more than 50% only the majority of events in Syria.

## Data source
For each incident, the database records the:

* Date
* Country and specific location, including geocodes
* Number of aid workers affected (victims)
* Sex of victims
* Institutional affiliation of victims (UN/Red Cross/NGO/other)
* Type of staff (national or international)*
* Outcome of the incident (victims killed/wounded/kidnapped)
* Means of violence (e.g. shooting, IED, aerial bombardment)
* Context of attack (ambush, armed incursion, etc.)
* Summary of incident (public details)

## Future steps
The next steps of this analysis will be to create a spatial regression model to understand the relationship between local context, incidents and consequences on aid provision (such as suspensions of programmes and withdrawals).
